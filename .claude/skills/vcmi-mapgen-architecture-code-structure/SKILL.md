Load when choosing between a function and a class, growing a parameter list or a module, adding a setting or a file path, reading a value another stage fills, or reviewing structure. hexagonal-architecture covers the boundaries between layers.

# Code Structure — Rules That Can Fire

[`../vcmi-mapgen-architecture-hexagonal-architecture/SKILL.md`](../vcmi-mapgen-architecture-hexagonal-architecture/SKILL.md)
governs the boundaries **between** rings: which way dependencies point, what a port may name, where
infrastructure is allowed to live. This skill governs the inside of a single ring — the decisions
that never trip a layering check and produce most of the damage anyway: a 1,600-line module, a
twelve-parameter function, a dict returned where a type belonged, an environment variable read at
import time.

## Every rule owes a trigger

Most structural guidance is unfalsifiable. "Prefer small modules." "Model state and behavior as a
class." Both are true; neither has ever stopped anyone, because you get to decide *after the fact*
whether the module was small enough or the behavior meaningful. Compare a rule like "no relative
imports": it fires, so it holds.

So every rule below has four parts, and a candidate rule that cannot fill all four does not belong
in this file:

| Part | What it must be |
|---|---|
| **Statement** | what to do |
| **Trigger** | a *shape in the code* a reader or a grep can detect — never a judgment |
| **Fix** | the specific transformation |
| **Counter-case** | when the trigger fires and you are still right |

The counter-case is not politeness. A rule with no stated exception gets applied where it does
harm, and then gets abandoned entirely.

---

## How to use this file

**Scan the trigger table at the bottom.** It is the whole rule set, one row per rule, each row a
shape you can detect by reading or grepping. Nothing else here is needed to *notice* a violation.

When a row fires, open the file holding it for the statement, the fix, the counter-case, and the
reason the rule exists. Each carries a quarter of the rule set:

- **[references/objects.md](references/objects.md)** — rules 1.1–1.4. When a pile of functions
  becomes an object, and the stop condition that says it does not. Read it when you are weighing a
  function against a class, growing a parameter list, or looking at module-level mutable state.
- **[references/modules.md](references/modules.md)** — rules 2.1–2.4. When one module is really
  two, or one function is only a corridor to another. Read it when writing a module's docstring,
  when an entry point started doing the work, when a private helper has only one caller, or when a
  section banner just went into a file that already does something else.
- **[references/boundaries.md](references/boundaries.md)** — rules 3.1–3.3. Values written and read
  back, returns with several pieces, and payloads from a schema you do not own. Read it when
  designing a checkpoint, a wire format, or a reader for another tool's output.
- **[references/config-and-effects.md](references/config-and-effects.md)** — rules 4.1–4.3. Where
  configuration may be read and where a side effect may live. Read it when adding a setting, a
  file path, a default parameter, a cache write, or a `sleep`.

- **[references/control-flow.md](references/control-flow.md)**: rules 6.1 to 6.5. When a branch
  chain is a table, and when a loop is doing more than one job. Read it when you write an `elif` on
  a kind, copy a function to change its numbers, nest a loop, or add a fallback pass.
- **[references/contracts.md](references/contracts.md)**: rules 7.1 to 7.6. Which assumptions must
  raise, and when a signature serves two purposes. Read it when a field is filled by another stage,
  when you search for something that must exist, or when you add a boolean or optional callback
  parameter.

Rules 2.5 to 2.10 in modules.md cover where shared code lives: below every feature that uses it,
in a module whose name predicts it, in a directory of its kind, with one owner per decoding,
constant and domain fact, and no module that only tests import. Rules 1.5 to 1.8 in objects.md
keep derived analysis off a core model, keep one model per entity, keep an index read-only after it
is built, and keep a function's parameters to the data it reads.

Rule 5 stays here, because it is the one to carry without looking anything up.

---

## 5. The question that catches most of the above

**A monkeypatched private name is a missing injection point.**

**Trigger.** A test that reaches into a module and replaces a private/internal function, or that
reassigns module state to set up a scenario.

**Fix.** Whatever the test needed to control is a dependency. Inject it.

Keep this one close, because it is the cheapest available proxy for every rule here. Ports that
name only domain types, absent collaborators that are null objects, injected settings, classifiers
free of I/O, an injected clock — all of them pay off in one observable currency: **can this be
tested without patching?** A reviewer who cannot recall the taxonomy can still ask that.

The tell that a patch-based seam has gone wrong is when a test must know the *wrong component's*
internals to set up its scenario — faking any backend's failure by patching one specific backend's
private function, say. At that point the seam is not merely informal, it is in the wrong place.

**Counter-case.** Patching at a genuine third-party boundary you do not own and cannot inject
around — the standard library's clock, the process table. Prefer a thin owned wrapper even there,
but this is the exception that is real.

| [7.4](references/contracts.md) | `continue` before writes a later stage reads | write the fallback or raise |
| [7.5](references/contracts.md) | a boolean tested in several `if`s, or derived from a kind | pass rules as a value |
| [7.6](references/contracts.md) | 2+ optional callbacks, or a `quiet`/`dry_run` parameter | planner returns a plan |

When you add a rule to this file, add its row. A rule with no row is a preference, and preferences
belong in a review comment rather than a skill.
