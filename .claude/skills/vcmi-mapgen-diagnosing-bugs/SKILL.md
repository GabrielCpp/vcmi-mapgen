description: "Diagnosis discipline for a hard bug, a flake, or a performance regression, in any codebase: build a loop that goes red on this bug before forming any hypothesis, reproduce and minimise, rank 3 to 5 falsifiable hypotheses, instrument one variable at a time behind a tagged prefix, and land the fix behind a regression test at a confirmed seam. When some examples fail and others pass, rank the hypotheses by contrast: which examples each one would change, scored against the failing set and a shuffled control. Load when something is broken, throwing, failing intermittently or slower than it was, when a fix has already been attempted and did not hold, or when a test suite or a batch of inputs fails in part and you are choosing which hypothesis to test first. To judge whether a fix reaches the origin, load root-cause."

# Diagnosing bugs

A discipline for a bug that did not fall to the first look. Skip a phase only by saying which
one and why.

## Phase 1: a loop that goes red

**This is the skill.** Everything after it is mechanical. With a **tight** pass/fail signal
that goes **red** on *this* bug, bisection, hypothesis-testing and instrumentation all consume
it. Without one, no amount of reading code substitutes. Spend disproportionate effort here.

### Pick the seam

Reach for the highest seam that can go red on the symptom. A loop closer to the bug is faster
and sharper than one further away.

| Seam | Loop | Goes red on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit** | call the function directly from a test | one function's own logic |
| **Component** | the component's own test suite, narrowed to the case | anything inside one package or module |
| **CLI** | the command with a fixture input, diffed against a known-good output | an output regression |
| **Repo gate** | the lint, type or custom check whose exit status settles it | a standard the tree violates |
| **Live system** | the running system's status, logs, traces and telemetry | what a process actually did, or is doing now |
| **Replay** | the real payload, trace or event log saved to disk and driven through the code path | a bug only the production input triggers |
| **Throwaway harness** | a script in the scratchpad that calls the failing path directly | everything above being too far from the bug |

The repo's own tool skills and its `Makefile` name its concrete seams. Reach for those before
inventing one.

**Substitute, don't patch.** When code takes its collaborators as arguments or fields, a test
supplies its own. Assigning over module attributes means restoring them afterwards, and a loop
built on a patch that leaks is a loop that lies.

### Tighten the loop

Treat the loop as the product of this phase. Once you have *a* loop, make it:

- **Faster.** Narrow the test scope, skip unrelated setup, reuse a cached fixture.
- **Sharper.** Assert the user's exact symptom, not "did not crash".
- **More deterministic.** Pin time, seed randomness, isolate the filesystem, freeze the
  network. Clocks, random numbers and live network are the three that make a loop flap.

A 30-second flaky loop is barely better than none. A 2-second deterministic one is a
superpower.

### An intermittent bug

The goal is a **higher reproduction rate**, not a clean repro. Loop the trigger 100 times,
parallelise, add stress, narrow the timing window, inject a sleep at the suspected race. A 50%
flake is debuggable. A 1% flake is not, so raise the rate until it is.

### A bug that shows on a set

Some bugs fail several examples and pass others: part of a test suite, some inputs of a batch,
some seeds or configs. Make the loop run **every** example and print each verdict. The
**failing set** and the **passing set** it prints are the evidence Phase 3 ranks against, and
the passing set is the half that is easy to throw away.

### Completion criterion: a red-capable command you have already run

Phase 1 is done when you can name **one command**, and have **already run it at least once**
showing its invocation and output, that is:

- **Red-capable.** It drives the actual bug code path and asserts the **reported symptom**, so
  it goes red now and green once fixed.
- **Deterministic.** It gives the same verdict every run, or a pinned high reproduction rate.
- **Fast.** It takes seconds, not minutes.
- **Unattended.** It runs with no human in the middle.

Reading code to build a theory before that command exists is the exact failure this skill
prevents. No red-capable command, no Phase 2.

### When the loop cannot be built

Say so explicitly, list what you tried, and ask for one of: access to the environment that
reproduces it, a captured artifact (a log, a trace, a HAR, a core dump, the run's output
directory), or permission to add temporary instrumentation to the running system. Redact every
secret first: write `<REDACTED>` in its place, and build loops against a variable so the
credential stays out of what you show.

## Phase 2: reproduce, then minimise

Run the loop and watch it go red. Confirm three things:

- It produces the failure **the report described**, not a different one nearby. Wrong bug,
  wrong fix.
- It reproduces across runs, or at a rate high enough to debug against.
- You have captured the exact symptom (message, wrong value, timing), so a later phase can
  prove the fix addressed *it*.

Then shrink to the **smallest scenario that still goes red**. Cut inputs, callers, config, data
and steps **one at a time**, re-running after each cut. Done when every remaining element is
load-bearing: removing any one turns the loop green.

Every cut that turns the loop green is a passing neighbour of the failing scenario. Keep them.
They are the passing set when the bug started as a single failure.

A minimal repro shrinks the hypothesis space in Phase 3 and becomes the regression test in
Phase 5. Do not proceed until you have both reproduced and minimised.

## Phase 3: hypothesise

Generate **3 to 5 hypotheses before testing any of them**. Testing the first plausible one anchors
the whole diagnosis on it.

Each must be **falsifiable**. State the prediction: *if X is the cause, then changing Y makes
the bug disappear, and changing Z makes it worse.* A hypothesis with no prediction is a vibe.
Sharpen it or drop it.

**Rank by contrast, not by coverage.** A hypothesis earns its rank by separating the failing
examples from the passing ones. "Every failing run goes through X" is coverage, and the passing
runs usually go through X too. For each hypothesis, write down the examples whose verdict it
would change. The best one changes every failing example and no passing one. When the loop
prints more than a couple of each, read
[references/contrast-ranking.md](references/contrast-ranking.md) before ranking. It carries the
score, the shuffled control that tells a cause from a busy site, the check budget, peeling a
second fault, and where the method goes blind.

Show the ranked list before testing. The person who reported the bug often re-ranks it
instantly ("we deployed a change to #3 yesterday") or has already ruled one out. Do not block
on the answer. Proceed with your own ranking if nobody is there.

## Phase 4: instrument

Every probe maps to a specific prediction from Phase 3, and you **change one variable at a
time**.

1. Inspect state directly where the environment allows it. One breakpoint beats ten logs.
2. Otherwise log at the **boundary that distinguishes two hypotheses**, not everywhere.

**Tag every debug log with a unique prefix**, such as `[DEBUG-a4f2]`, so cleanup is one grep.
Untagged debug logs survive into the tree. Tagged ones die.

**A performance regression takes the other branch.** Logs are usually the wrong instrument.
Establish a baseline measurement first, from the system's own wall-time breakdown, a timer, or
a profiler for in-process work. Then bisect against that number. Measure first, fix second.

## Phase 5: fix behind a regression test at a confirmed seam

Write the regression test **before the fix**, but only at a **correct seam**: one where the
test exercises the real bug pattern as it occurs at the call site. A seam too shallow to
replicate the chain that triggered the bug gives false confidence, which is worse than no test.

**If no correct seam exists, that is itself the finding.** Say so. The architecture is what
prevents the bug from being locked down, and that belongs in the post-mortem.

With a correct seam:

1. Turn the minimised repro into a failing test there.
2. Watch it fail.
3. Apply the fix.
4. Watch it pass.
5. Re-run the Phase 1 loop against the **original, un-minimised** scenario, and against every
   example when the bug showed on a set.

## Phase 6: cleanup and post-mortem

Before calling it done:

- The original repro no longer reproduces. Re-run the Phase 1 loop, not the minimised one.
- The regression test passes, or the absence of a seam is written down.
- Every `[DEBUG-…]` probe is gone. Grep the prefix.
- Throwaway harnesses are deleted or left in the scratchpad, never in the tree.
- The repo's lint and type gates and the affected tests pass.
- **The hypothesis that turned out correct is in the commit message**, so the next person
  diagnosing near this code starts where you finished.

Then ask what would have prevented it. If the answer is a gate the repo could have had, that is
an automated check, not a note. Make the recommendation *after* the fix is in, because you know
more now than when you started.

## When to reach for the neighbours

- **You have a fix and must judge whether it reaches the origin**, or you are about to add a
  retry, a waiver, a default or a broader catch: [[root-cause]].
- **The loop runs one of the repo's own tools**, such as its test harness, its telemetry or its
  graph checks: the skill that owns that tool carries its commands and its traps.
