# Research study

A study searches a field of solutions and reports on the whole field. The output is a
**ledger**: every probe, what it cost, what it settled, and the failures in full. The best
result is one row in it.

Four traps turn a study into one idea pursued for days:

- **The first idea wins.** One plausible fix absorbs the session, and the rest of the field
  is never compared against it.
- **The yardstick moves.** Each probe runs on different inputs, so no two results compare.
- **Apparatus eats the time.** Hours go to making an experiment runnable, and nothing asks
  whether the experiment still matters.
- **A number is recorded and never judged.** A result that projects to three weeks against
  an eight-hour purpose gets logged, and the next slice starts.

You do not perceive wall-clock time. A 15-minute command and a 1-minute command reach you
as one result each. The ledger's timestamps are how you see time. Read them.

## 1. State the purpose as a number

Write one sentence: what must improve, the target, and the full workload it applies to.
"1,000 pages in 8 hours" is a purpose. It also gives the per-unit bar: 28 seconds a page.
Every later projection is held against this sentence.

Done when the sentence carries a target number and a workload size.

## 2. Freeze the yardstick

Pick the benchmark: a small fixed set of inputs that covers the kinds the workload holds.
Run the current system on it and record the baseline row. Pin what defines the yardstick:
the input set, the commit, the seeds, and the judge or scorer. The judge stays frozen for
the whole study. The cheapest way to look faster is to make the judge pass sooner, so a
change to the judge is its own probe, reported as one.

Done when the baseline row is in the ledger with the commit and input set it ran on.

## 3. Profile before any hypothesis

Break the baseline cost down by stage, by turn, by test, or by call. Take the breakdown
from what the system records, or add the recording first. A total says something is slow.
A breakdown says one fixture runs 400 times, or one turn reads the whole corpus. The
hypotheses come from the breakdown.

Done when the top cost items are named with their share of the total.

## 4. Map the field

When the project already keeps a field of candidates, read it first and extend it. Then
load [[brainstorm]] and generate candidates that differ in **mechanism**: less input per
step, fewer steps, a cheaper model per stage, different work order, skipping work a cheap
check proves unneeded, parallelism, a different instrument.

The field always holds the **no-method control**: the simplest mechanism that uses none of
the idea under test, such as brute-force search, a fixed rule, or the unchanged system
given the same extra compute. Measure it early. When it matches the method, the yardstick
cannot credit the method, and that is a finding about the yardstick. For each candidate
write:

- the expected gain, tied to a line of the profile,
- the cost to test it,
- the result that would kill it.

Write the field into the study's file, where it outlives the session. With an operator
present, stop here and show the field. Alone, order it by expected gain over cost to
test and start at the top.

Done when the field holds at least as many candidates as the profile has cost items, each
with its kill result.

## 5. Probe

**Read the ceiling before running the instrument.** Most instruments have an expensive
part: a model call, a full rerun, a human judge. Compute the best result the run could
show from its inputs alone, with the expensive part assumed to go the candidate's way
wherever it is uncertain. A ceiling under the bar kills the run before it costs anything.
It takes minutes where the run takes days, and it reads the same inputs the run would.

**Order by cost before launching anything.** List the next decisive checks with their
estimates, and run the cheapest first. A long job in the background is not free: a
three-minute check can make its answer moot, and then the long job is apparatus for
nothing.

Change one variable per probe, on the frozen yardstick. Before each probe, write two
things into its ledger row:

- **What it settles.** "This changes the answer by ⟨how⟩, and a result of ⟨X⟩ settles
  ⟨claim⟩." A probe that settles nothing is `exploration`, labelled so.
- **The estimate.** Wall minutes, from the profile or a timed single unit.

Run anything over a few minutes as a background job with a log, and do cheap work while it
runs. Combine winners only after each has won alone, and measure the combination as its
own probe.

## 6. Record, including the failures

One ledger row per step, appended before the step starts and completed when it ends. The
command that appends the row takes the start time from `date -Iseconds`, so the row exists
before the work does. A row written after the step began says its start is reconstructed.
Each row carries its `kind`:

| kind | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `decisive` | its result settles a claim about the purpose |
| `exploration` | it informs the field without settling anything |
| `apparatus` | it makes a decisive step runnable, and names that step |
| `reflection` | a step back, written by the triggers in step 8 |

A failed probe keeps its row with the reason it failed. The row is the report.

The row format is in [references/ledger.md](references/ledger.md).

## 7. Project every result against the purpose

When a number arrives, extrapolate it to the full workload and hold it against the
sentence from step 1. Write the projection into the row's outcome: "30 min a page × 1,000
pages is 3 weeks against 8 hours: 60× off." A path that projects 10× off the purpose is
dead as it stands. Say so in the row, then go back to the field for a candidate that
changes the order of magnitude.

A result that means the instrument cannot resolve the target is the most valuable reading
a study produces. "Every arm scores zero" says the full run can only compare zero with
zero. Stop that path before spending on it.

## 8. Step back

Write a `reflection` row when any of these fires:

- a step ran more than 3× its estimate,
- two hours of wall time passed since the last reflection,
- `apparatus` holds more than half the time since the last reflection,
- three probes in a row moved nothing.

A reflection answers three questions: where did the time go, what has been settled, and is
the current path still the cheapest route to the purpose. If it is not, name the cheaper
route and take it. Continuing is a decision the reflection has to argue for.

## 9. Stop and report

The study stops when:

- the purpose is met on the yardstick, with the judge's pass rate no lower than baseline,
- the field is exhausted,
- the next step needs the operator: a frozen bar, target or judge would change, money would
  be spent, or two reflections in a row found no cheaper route.

Write the report from the ledger. The format is in
[references/report.md](references/report.md).
